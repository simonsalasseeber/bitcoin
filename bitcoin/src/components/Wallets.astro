                        <li><strong>Mobile:</strong> Designed for the era of ubiquitous computing. These wallets embody the principle of financial freedom - your money, always at your fingertips.</li>
                        <li><strong>Desktop:</strong> Offering a balance between security and usability. Ideal for those who prefer to manage their finances from a dedicated machine.</li>
                        <li><strong>Web:</strong> While convenient, these represent a trade-off in the core principle of decentralization. Use with caution.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> The epitome of security in the digital age. These devices bridge the gap between the intangible nature of Bitcoin and the physical world.</li>

                        <li><strong>Full Node:</strong> The backbone of the Bitcoin network. By running a full node, you're not just using Bitcoin; you're actively participating in its consensus and security.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lightweight (SPV):</strong> A compromise between full autonomy and practicality. These clients verify transactions without the full burden of the blockchain.</li>
                        <li><strong>Third-Party API:</strong> While convenient, these solutions introduce trust, which goes against Bitcoin's trustless nature. Use them understanding the trade-offs.</li>

                        <li><strong>Non-Custodial:</strong> The true embodiment of "be your own bank". With great power comes great responsibility - your keys, your coins, your responsibility.</li>
                        <li><strong>Custodial:</strong> While they may seem convenient, remember: if you don't control the keys, you don't truly own the Bitcoin. This model reintroduces the very trust issues Bitcoin was designed to solve.</li>

        The diversity of Bitcoin wallets reflects the core principles of decentralization and individual sovereignty. Choose wisely, for your wallet is not just a tool, but a philosophical statement about the future of money.
