                        <li><strong>mobile:</strong> designed for the era of ubiquitous computing. these wallets embody the principle of financial freedom - your money, always at your fingertips.</li>
                        <li><strong>desktop:</strong> offering a balance between security and usability. ideal for those who prefer to manage their finances from a dedicated machine.</li>
                        <li><strong>web:</strong> while convenient, these represent a trade-off in the core principle of decentralization. use with caution.</li>
                        <li><strong>hardware:</strong> the epitome of security in the digital age. these devices bridge the gap between the intangible nature of bitcoin and the physical world.</li>

                        <li><strong>full node:</strong> the backbone of the bitcoin network. by running a full node, you're not just using bitcoin; you're actively participating in its consensus and security.</li>
                        <li><strong>lightweight (spv):</strong> a compromise between full autonomy and practicality. these clients verify transactions without the full burden of the blockchain.</li>
                        <li><strong>third-party api:</strong> while convenient, these solutions introduce trust, which goes against bitcoin's trustless nature. use them understanding the trade-offs.</li>

                        <li><strong>non-custodial:</strong> the true embodiment of "be your own bank". with great power comes great responsibility - your keys, your coins, your responsibility.</li>
                        <li><strong>custodial:</strong> while they may seem convenient, remember: if you don't control the keys, you don't truly own the bitcoin. this model reintroduces the very trust issues bitcoin was designed to solve.</li>

        not every wallet is created equal. pro-tip: when choosing a wallet, always keep in mind decentralization and individual sovereignty.
